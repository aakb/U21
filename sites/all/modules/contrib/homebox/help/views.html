Home box takes all its power when used with <a href="http://drupal.org/project/views">Views 2</a>. Views 2 allows to create dynamic views (say lists) of your content that user can play with: filters, pagination, etc. all this Ajax enabled.

<div class="help-box">
  <strong><a href="#summary">You can jump to the summary</a></strong>, if you have already read this topic.
</div>

In order to get a really interactive Home box page, there are a few things to set in your View. As an example, we will use a simple view that lists published content.
<br />
First, let's take a look at what we want.

<a href="path:images/views-pagination.png"><img src="path:images/views-pagination.png" width="339" /></a>

<a href="path:images/views-exposed-filter.png"><img src="path:images/views-exposed-filter.png" width="339" /></a>

In our View, the first thing we need is a <strong>block</strong> display.
<br />
Then in the general settings be sure to have the following settings enabled or set (click image to enlarge).

<a href="path:images/views-basic-settings.png"><img src="path:images/views-basic-settings.png" width="339" /></a>

Now you can as usually set other properties (style, fields, etc.).
<br />
We now need to add exposed filters. So add <strong>Node type</strong> in filters section. Be sure to click <strong>Expose</strong> button. Like in the following screenshot.

<a href="path:images/views-expose-button.png"><img src="path:images/views-expose-button.png" width="339" /></a>

Don't forget to set the following properties in your exposed filter setting pane.

<a href="path:images/views-expose-config.png"><img src="path:images/views-expose-config.png" width="339" /></a>

With all this, you should have a full featured Ajax block available for your Home box.
<br />
<a name="summary"></a>
<h3>Summary</h3>
So you need to check that your view:
<ul>
  <li>has a <strong>title</strong></li>
  <li>is <strong>Ajax</strong> enabled</li>
  <li>has <strong>a pager</strong></li>
  <li>has <strong>exposed form in block</strong> set to YES</li>
  <li>has an <strong>empty text</strong> value</li>
  <li>has an <strong>admin name</strong> (not mandatory, but better for you)</li>
  <li><strong>exposes</strong> some filters</li>
  <li>your filters have <strong>remember</strong> checkbox checked</li>
</ul>
