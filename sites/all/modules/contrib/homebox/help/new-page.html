Go to <a href="base_url:admin/build/homebox">Administer > Site building > Home box</a>. In the form as shown below, type a name in the input. Then click <em>Add page</em>.
<br />
<a href="path:images/new-page.png"><img src="path:images/new-page.png" /></a>
<br />
The form reloads with your newly created page listed. It is good pratice to visit the <strong>edit</strong> section. Let's go for it.
<br />
<a href="path:images/edit-go.png"><img src="path:images/edit-go.png" /></a>
<br />
From here you can edit or delete your page. But what we want is to give an URL alias for that page. Otherwise, it will be only available through <em>http://www.exemple.com/homebox/1</em>, which isn't really user friendly.
<br />
<a href="path:images/edit-form.png"><img src="path:images/edit-form.png" /></a>
<br />
You can save your change by clicking the <strong>Save page</strong> button and you can go to <a href="topic:homebox/default-layout">default layout</a> topic.
